2/ Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

Answer: Thinking calmly. 6 React concepts were taught and I used them when needed. First, I created the component, then created the Jsx file and created the component function there. Since I will work with Api data inside it, first I collected data using useEffect and since that data will be passed to another component, I copied it with a useState declarer. Now I will check the copied data whether it is object or array. If it is an array then I will dynamically return the elements as props to another component. I have sent it as props because I will receive it as props in that component. Then by Destructuring those props, I can dynamically show them on the wave page in jsx.
